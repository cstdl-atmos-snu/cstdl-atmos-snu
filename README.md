We are a research group at Seoul National University led by Prof. Daehyun Kim.

We study convective systems and waves in the tropics, among others.

This github page is for developing and sharing the codes that we use 
1) to perform various statistical analysis using observations and model simulations; and
2) to make plots using various forms of datasets.
